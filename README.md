><h1>Object-Oriented and Concurrent Programming</h1>
><h2>CMSC 335</h2>
><p>A study of object-oriented and concurrent programming using features of Java. The goal is to design, implement, test, debug, and document complex robust programs in an object-oriented language. Concepts of object-oriented programming (such as composition, classification, and polymorphism) are explored. Topics include the principles of concurrent programming (such as task synchronization, race conditions, deadlock, threads, and event-driven graphic user interface programs). Programming projects are implemented in Java.</p>
